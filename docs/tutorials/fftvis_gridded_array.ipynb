    "Simulating radio interferometer visibilities involves calculating the contribution of many sky sources to the signal correlation measured by each baseline pair. For point sources, this is mathematically expressed as a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(\\mathbf{b}) \\approx \\sum_{j=1}^{N_{\\rm sources}} c_j \\, e^{-2\\pi i \\nu \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{x}_j/c}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating this sum directly is computationally intensive, scaling as $\\mathcal{O}(N_{\\rm sources} N_{\\rm bls})$, which becomes prohibitive for large source catalogs ($N_{\\rm sources}$) or many baselines ($N_{\\rm bls}$). `fftvis` accelerates this computation significantly by using the non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT), specifically using the high-performance `finufft` library. The exact NUFFT approach and its computational scaling depend on the geometric layout of the array baselines.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the general case where array baseline vectors $\\mathbf{b}_k$ do not form a regular grid (or when considering effects that break perfect regularity, such as errors in antenna placement), `fftvis` treats both the source positions $\\mathbf{x}_j$ and the target baseline coordinates $\\mathbf{u}_k = (\\nu/c)\\mathbf{b}_k$ as non-uniform. This \"non-uniform to non-uniform\" calculation is handled using a **Type 3 NUFFT**. This algorithm internally uses an intermediate uniform grid to perform the bulk of the computation via a standard FFT. The computational cost scales approximately as $\\mathcal{O}(N_{\\rm sources} w^d + N_{\\rm grid} \\log N_{\\rm grid} + N_{\\rm bls} w^d)$. Here, $w$ relates to the desired precision, $d$ is the number of dimensions (2 or 3), and $N_{\\rm grid,int}$ is the size of the intermediate grid. Most notably, $N_{\\rm grid}$ depends on the product of the maximum sky source extent and the maximum baseline extent (in wavelengths), and can become quite large, especially for wide fields or long baselines, impacting the computational performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a more efficient approach is possible if the array's baseline vectors $\\mathbf{b}_k$ inherently form a regular Cartesian grid (meaning $b_x = k \\Delta b_x$, $b_y = l \\Delta b_y$, etc., for fixed spacings $\\Delta b_x, \\Delta b_y$). Since the source positions $\\mathbf{x}_j$ remain non-uniform, this becomes a \"non-uniform to uniform\" problem, ideally suited for a **Type 1 NUFFT**. The Type 1 NUFFT computes visibilities directly onto a uniform output grid covering the extent of the baseline coordinates. Let $N_{\\rm unif}$ be the number of points in this target uniform $uv$-grid. The computational scaling for the Type 1 NUFFT is approximately $\\mathcal{O}(N_{\\rm sources} w^d + N_{\\rm unif} \\log N_{\\rm unif})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing the two, the Type 1 NUFFT can be significantly faster than Type 3 if its $N_{\\rm unif} \\log N_{\\rm unif}$ term is considerably smaller than the corresponding $N_{\\rm grid} \\log N_{\\rm grid} + N_{\\rm bls} w^d$ terms from Type 3. This advantage occurs when the target uniform grid defined by the baselines ($N_{\\rm unif}$) is much smaller than the intermediate grid ($N_{\\rm grid}$) that Type 3 requires to handle the general non-uniform case across the same sky and baseline extents. Therefore, for arrays whose baselines naturally form a compact, regular grid, utilizing a Type 1 NUFFT offers a potential performance boost by using this structure. \n",

    "Once the simulation parameters are set, the computation is run using the `fftvis.simulate` function. By default, `fftvis` first checks if the provided antenna positions form a regular grid. It does this by using the shortest two non-collinear baseline vectors to define a potential grid basis and then verifying if all antenna positions fit onto that grid. This approach allows `fftvis` to recognize various grid layouts, even those that are skewed or rotated relative to the coordinate axes (like hexagonal arrays, which are essentially skewed regular grids). If a grid is detected, `fftvis` automatically uses the computationally faster Type 1 NUFFT. Since this automatic detection might be unexpected or hide potential configuration issues, the `force_use_type3` parameter is available. Setting this allows a user to enforce the use of the more general Type 3 NUFFT, even if the antenna positions technically form a grid. Additionally, `fftvis` logs a message to inform the user whenever it detects a gridded array configuration and switches to the Type 1 transform.\n",
